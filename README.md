# Housing Needs Assessments Automation

This repo is the structure behind the future in-depth HNAs that HART provides.  

The project is built on [Python docx template](https://github.com/elapouya/python-docx-template)
which uses `python-docx` and `jinja` internally, and the report's variables
will reflect this syntax.
